Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-Routes

    - When registering routes, also try to automatically register the run mode
      names. We will register a run mode when there is not already one defined 
      with the target name, and we 'can' call a method with the same name. (Mark Stosberg)
    - Create a proper automated test script (Mark Stosberg)
    - Load Data::Dumper only when needed, not every time (Mark Stosberg)
    - Update 'import' to provide reality checks and better diagnostics (Mark Stosberg)

=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes - Routes-style dispatching for CGI::Application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes tries to bring to Perl some of the goodies of
Rails routes by allowing the creation of a routes table that is parsed at the
prerun stage against $ENV{PATH_INFO}.  The result of the process (if there's
any match at the end of the process) is added to CGI query method from
CGI::Application and available in all the runmodes via 
C<< $self->query->param >>.  By doing this, the plugin provides a
uniform way of accessing GET and POST parameters when using clean URIs.

Example:

In TestApp.pm

	package TestApp;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use base qw/CGI::Application/;
	use CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes;
	sub setup {
		my $self = shift;

        # routes_root optionally is used to prepend a URI part to every route
		$self->routes_root('/thismod'); 
		$self->routes([
			'' => 'home' ,
			'/view/:name/:id/:email'  => 'view',
		]);
		$self->start_mode('show');

		$self->tmpl_path('templates/');
	}
	sub view {
		my $self  = shift;
		my $q     = $self->query();
		my $name  = $q->param('name');
		my $id    = $q->param('id');
		my $email = $q->param('email');
		my $debug = $self->routes_dbg; #dumps all the C::A::P::Routes info
		my $params = $self->routes_params; #shows params found.
		return $self->dump_html();
	}
	1;

Note that we did not have to call run_modes() to register the run modes.
CGI::Application::Plugin::Routes will automatically register each route as run
modes if there is no run mode registered with that name, and your application
can call target as a method.

=head1 EXPORTED METHODS

=head2 routes

Is exported so it can be called from the CGI::Application app to receive the
routes table.  If no routes table is provided to the module, it will warn and
return 0 and no harm will be done to the CGI query params.

=head2 routes_root

This method makes it possible to set a common root for all the routes passed to
the plugin, to avoid unnecessary repetition.

=head2 routes_parse

Is exported in order to make the callback available into the CGI::Application
based app. Not meant to be invoked manually.

=head2 routes_params

This method return a array of all the params found in the query_string

=cut

=head2 routes_dbg

Is exported so you can see what happened on the Routes guts.

Michael Peter's CGI::Application::Dispatch module that can be found here:
L<http://search.cpan.org/~wonko/CGI-Application-Dispatch>
I borrowed from him most of the routine that parses the url.

Mark Stosberg L<http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/> Provided very valuable
feedback and some useful patches and changes to the code.
